# TODO
- make a sample implementation of the ai module, remove the ai enemy grunt file afterwards.
- introduce something like input consumption
- scene root entity is pretty clunky, maybe have a built in entity for every scene
- clean up utils

# To document
- Settings -> how do they work, how do you use them, how to set defaults, how to use scripts/sync_settings.py
