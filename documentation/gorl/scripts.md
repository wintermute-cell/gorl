## sync_settings.py
Based on the `GameSettings` struct found in `settings.go`, edits files to
generate fallback settings in `settings.go` and fills out the `settings.json`
file in `assets`. 

The values written as comments are used as default values:
```go
TargetFps    int  `json:"targetFps"`    // 144
```

Usage example:
```bash
python scripts/sync_settings.py [path/to/settings.go path/to/settings.json]
```

If no path is given, the following defaults apply: 
```
./internal/settings/settings.go
./assets/settings.json
```
